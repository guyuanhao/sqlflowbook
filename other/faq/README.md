### Q1: How to deal with internal database?

If your database is deployed in an internal network which is not accessable for external connection request, you can:

1. Use [sqlflow-ingester](broken-reference) to export the database metadata file.
2. Create sqlflow job by [uploading that metadata file on our SQLFlow UI](../../introduction/ui/job-management/job-sources.md#upload-file).&#x20;

Check [deal with internal database](deal-with-internal-database.md) for more details.
