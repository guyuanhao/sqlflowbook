# Job mode

SQLFlow Job mode is dedicated for handling large amounts of SQL Scripts or directly connecting to the target database server for the data linenage analysis. Config parameters for the analysis should be given when creating a new SQLFlow Job and the parameters cannot be changed once submitted.&#x20;

### Job type

There are two job types:

* Simple Job
* Regular Job

&#x20;

Both job types support reading large amounts of SQL files or analysis through DB directly. There are some differences between Simple Job and Regular Job.
