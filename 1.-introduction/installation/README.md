# Installation

Gudu SQLFow is extremely simple to install and is comprised of two parts: frontend and backend. The frontend and backend can be installed on the same server, or they can be installed on two different servers seperately.

* [Linux](linux.md)
* [MacOS](macos/)
* [Windows](windows/)

If you need to enable regular job features, you will also need to install Clickhouse on your server: [Clickhouse Installation](clickhouse-installation/clickhouse-for-centos.md).

You can check for [SQLFlow Widget](../../4.-sqlflow-widget/get-started.md) once you have your SQLFlow on-premise Installed on your server and Widget will read the data from the SQLFlow on your server.
