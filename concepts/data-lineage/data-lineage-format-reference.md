# Data lineage format reference

### 1. Top level elements

* dbvendor: string, SQL dialects such as oracle, mysql
* dbobjs: array, database objects such as table, view and etc
* relations: array, column-level relationship

### 2. dbobjs

This is an array that includes all database objects discovered during the data lineage analysis. JSON PATH: `$.dbobjs`.

#### Attributes

* id, this is the unique identifier of this object in the data lineage result.
* name, name of the object.
* type, type of the object such as table, view, process.
* coordinates, position of the object in the SQL script.
* columns, optional, valid when type is table, view

### 3. realtions

Relation is the atom unit of the data lineage. Relation build a link between the source and target column( column-level lineage).

Those relations are stored in the `$.relations`.

A relation includes the `type`, `target`, `sources` and other attributes.

#### Attributes

* id
* type
* effectType
* target, is an object
* sources, array of source objects
* processid, optional

### List of the elements in data lineage

#### 1. Database object

* schema

#### 2. Schema object

* table, including external table
* view
* procedure
* function
* trigger

#### 3. Hdfs object

* file, such as `/user/data/pv_2008-06-08_us.txt, gs://bucket/path1.csv`
* directory, such as `s3://load/encrypted_files/`, `@exttable_part_stage/logs/`
* stage, this is a directory.

#### 4. SQL object

Object created temporary during the execution of the SQL statement.

* select list
* merge insert
* merge update
* update set
* update select
* insert select
* function call
* union
* CTE
* pivot table
* snowflake pivot alias
* sql server open json
* sql server join property
* set of rows ( constructed through the values expression, used in the place where table occurs)
* process, this the the SQL query that does the data transform.

#### 5. Relation

* fdd , dataflow
* fdr , data impact

#### 6. join

#### 7. Abbreviation of the object

The abbreviation of the object used in the diagram generated by the Gudu SQLFlow.

* directory \[D]
* function \[F]
* function call \[F]
* file \[FL]
