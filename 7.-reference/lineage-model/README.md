# Lineage Model

Lineage models are the results generated by SQLFlow after analyzing the inputs of  SQL/File/Database. Lineage model describes the data lineage and it can be under **Json** format or under **XML** format.

## Json Format Lineage Model

The data lineages generated by SQLFlow and by [Dlineage tool](../../1.-introduction/java-library/) with `/json` flag are under json format. Read [here](json-format-lineage-model.md) to get more details about Json format lineage model.

## XML Format Lineage Model

We will have lineage model under XML format by [Dlineage tool](../../1.-introduction/java-library/) without `/json` flag. Check [this page](xml-format-lineage-model.md) to learn more about the lineage model in XML.
